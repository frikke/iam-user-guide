# Delete an IAM user using an AWS SDK<a name="example_iam_DeleteUser_section"></a>

The following code examples show how to delete an IAM user\. 

**Warning**  
To avoid security risks, don't use IAM users for authentication when developing purpose\-built software or working with real data\. Instead, use federation with an identity provider such as [AWS IAM Identity Center \(successor to AWS Single Sign\-On\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html)\.

**Note**  
The source code for these examples is in the [AWS Code Examples GitHub repository](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples)\. Have feedback on a code example? [Create an Issue](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/issues/new/choose) in the code examples repo\.
