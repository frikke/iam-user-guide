# Create read\-only and read\-write IAM users using an AWS SDK<a name="example_iam_Scenario_UserPolicies_section"></a>

The following code example shows how to create users and attach policies to them\. 

**Warning**  
To avoid security risks, don't use IAM users for authentication when developing purpose\-built software or working with real data\. Instead, use federation with an identity provider such as [AWS IAM Identity Center \(successor to AWS Single Sign\-On\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html)\.
+ Create two IAM users\.
+ Attach a policy for one user to get and put objects in an Amazon S3 bucket\.
+ Attach a policy for the second user to get objects from the bucket\.
+ Get different permissions to the bucket based on user credentials\.

**Note**
