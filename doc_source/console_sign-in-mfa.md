# Using MFA devices with your IAM sign\-in page<a name="console_sign-in-mfa"></a>

Users who are configured with [multi\-factor authentication \(MFA\)](id_credentials_mfa.md) devices must use their MFA devices to sign in to the AWS Management Console\. After the user enters their sign\-in credentials, AWS checks the user's account to see if MFA is required for that user\. The following sections provide information on how users complete signing in when MFA is required\.

## Signing in with multiple MFA devices enabled<a name="console_sign-in-multiple-mfa"></a>

If a user signs in to the AWS Management Console as an AWS account root user or IAM user with multiple MFA devices enabled for that account, they only need to use one MFA device to sign in\. After the user authenticates with the userâ€™s password, they select which MFA device type they would like to use to finish authenticating\. Then the user is prompted to authenticate with the type of device that they selected\. 

## Signing in with a FIDO security key<a name="console_sign-in-mfa-fido"></a>

If MFA is required for the user, a second sign\-in page appears\. The user needs to tap the FIDO security key\.

**Note**  
Google Chrome users should not choose any of the available options on the pop\-up that asks to **Verify your identity with amazon\.com**\. You only need to tap on the security key\.

Unlike other MFA devices, FIDO security keys do not go out of sync\. Administrators can deactivate a FIDO security key if it's lost or broken\. For more information, see [Deactivating MFA devices \(console\)](id_credentials_mfa_disable.md#deactive-mfa-console)\.

For information on browsers that support WebAuthn and FIDO\-compliant devices that AWS supports, see [Supported configurations for using FIDO security keys](id_credentials_mfa_fido_supported_configurations.md)\.

## Signing in with a virtual MFA device<a name="console_sign-in-mfa-virtual"></a>

If MFA is required for the user, a second sign\-in page appears\. In the **MFA code** box, the user must enter the numeric code provided by the MFA application\.

If the MFA code is correct, the user can access the AWS Management Console\. If the code is incorrect, the user can try again with another code\. 

A virtual MFA device can go out of sync\. If a user cannot sign in to the AWS Management Console after several tries, the user is prompted to synchronize the virtual MFA device\. The user can follow the on\-screen prompts to synchronize the virtual MFA device\. For information about how you can synchronize a device on behalf of a user in your AWS account, see [Resynchronizing virtual and hardware MFA devices](id_credentials_mfa_sync.md)\. 

## Signing in with a hardware TOTP token<a name="console_sign-in-mfa-hardware"></a>

If MFA is required for the user, a second sign\-in page appears\. In the **MFA code** box, the user must enter the numeric code provided by a hardware TOTP token\. 

If the MFA code is correct, the user can access the AWS Management Console\. If the code is incorrect, the user can try again with another code\. 

A hardware TOTP token can go out of sync\. If a user can't sign in to the AWS Management Console after several tries, the user is prompted to synchronize the MFA token device\. The user can follow the on\-screen prompts to synchronize the MFA token device\. For information about how you can synchronize a device on behalf of a user in your AWS account, see [Resynchronizing virtual and hardware MFA devices](id_credentials_mfa_sync.md)\.
