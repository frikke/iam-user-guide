# AWS managed policies for AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer<a name="security-iam-awsmanpol"></a>







To add permissions to users, groups, and roles, it is easier to use AWS managed policies than to write policies yourself\. It takes time and expertise to [create IAM customer managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create-console.html) that provide your team with only the permissions they need\. To get started quickly, you can use our AWS managed policies\. These policies cover common use cases and are available in your AWS account\. For more information about AWS managed policies, see [AWS managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#aws-managed-policies) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

AWS services maintain and update AWS managed policies\. You can't change the permissions in AWS managed policies\. Services occasionally add additional permissions to an AWS managed policy to support new features\. This type of update affects all identities \(users, groups, and roles\) where the policy is attached\. Services are most likely to update an AWS managed policy when a new feature is launched or when new operations become available\. Services do not remove permissions from an AWS managed policy, so policy updates won't break your existing permissions\.

Additionally, AWS supports managed policies for job functions that span multiple services\. For example, the ReadOnlyAccess AWS managed policy provides read\-only access to all AWS services and resources\. When a service launches a new feature, AWS adds read\-only permissions for new operations and resources\. For a list and descriptions of job function policies, see [AWS managed policies for job functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_job-functions.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.









## IAMReadOnlyAccess<a name="security-iam-awsmanpol-IAMReadOnlyAccess"></a>

Use the `IAMReadOnlyAccess` managed policy to allow read only access to IAM resources\. This policy grants permission to get and list all IAM resources\. It allows viewing details and activity reports for users, groups, roles, policies, identity providers, and MFA devices\. It does not include the ability to create or delete resources or access to IAM Access Analyzer resources\. View the [policy](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/IAMReadOnlyAccess) for the full list of services and actions supported by this policy\. 

## IAMUserChangePassword<a name="security-iam-awsmanpol-IAMUserChangePassword"></a>

Use the `IAMUserChangePassword` managed policy to allow IAM users to change their password\.

You configure your IAM **Account settings** and the **Password policy** to allow IAM users to change their IAM account password\. When you allow this action, IAM attaches the following policy to each user:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:ChangePassword"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:iam::*:user/${aws:username}"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:GetAccountPasswordPolicy"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## IAMAccessAnalyzerFullAccess<a name="security-iam-awsmanpol-IAMAccessAnalyzerFullAccess"></a>

Use the `IAMAccessAnalyzerFullAccess` AWS managed policy to allow your administrators to access IAM Access Analyzer\.

### Permissions groupings<a name="IAMAccessAnalyzerFullAccess"></a>

This policy is grouped into statements based on the set of permissions provided\.
+ **IAM Access Analyzer** – Allows full administrative permissions to all resources in IAM Access Analyzer\.
+ **Create service linked role** – Allows the administrator to create a [ service\-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-using-service-linked-roles.html), which allows IAM Access Analyzer to analyze resources in other services on your behalf\. This permission allows creating the service\-linked role only for use by IAM Access Analyzer\.
+ **AWS Organizations** – Allows administrators to use IAM Access Analyzer for an organization in AWS Organizations\. After [enabling trusted access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html) for IAM Access Analyzer in AWS Organizations, members of the management account can view findings across their organization\.

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "access-analyzer:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "iam:AWSServiceName": "access-analyzer.amazonaws.com"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "organizations:DescribeAccount",
        "organizations:DescribeOrganization",
        "organizations:DescribeOrganizationalUnit",
        "organizations:ListAccounts",
        "organizations:ListAccountsForParent",
        "organizations:ListAWSServiceAccessForOrganization",
        "organizations:ListChildren",
        "organizations:ListDelegatedAdministrators",
        "organizations:ListOrganizationalUnitsForParent",
        "organizations:ListParents",
        "organizations:ListRoots"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## IAMAccessAnalyzerReadOnlyAccess<a name="security-iam-awsmanpol-IAMAccessAnalyzerReadOnlyAccess"></a>

Use the `IAMAccessAnalyzerReadOnlyAccess` AWS managed policy to allow read\-only access to IAM Access Analyzer\.

To also allow read\-only access to IAM Access Analyzer for AWS Organizations, create a customer managed policy that allows the Describe and List actions from the [IAMAccessAnalyzerFullAccess](#security-iam-awsmanpol-IAMAccessAnalyzerFullAccess) AWS managed policy\.

### Service\-level permissions<a name="IAMAccessAnalyzerReadOnlyAccess-service-level-permissions"></a>

This policy provides read\-only access to IAM Access Analyzer\. No other service permissions are included in this policy\.

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "access-analyzer:Get*",
        "access-analyzer:List*",
        "access-analyzer:ValidatePolicy"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## AccessAnalyzerServiceRolePolicy<a name="security-iam-aa-service-role-policy"></a>

You can't attach AccessAnalyzerServiceRolePolicy to your IAM entities\. This policy is attached to a service\-linked role that allows IAM Access Analyzer to perform actions on your behalf\. For more information, see [Using service\-linked roles for AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-using-service-linked-roles.html)\.

### Permissions groupings<a name="service-level-permissions"></a>

This policy allows access to IAM Access Analyzer to analyze resource metadata from multiple AWS services\.
+ **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud** – Allows permissions to describe IP addresses, snapshots, and VPCs\.
+ **Amazon Elastic Container Registry** – Allows permissions to describe image repositories and retrieve repository policies\.
+ **Amazon Elastic File System** – Allows permissions to view the description of an Amazon EFS file system and view the resource\-level policy for an Amazon EFS file system\.
