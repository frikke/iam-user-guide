# Integrating third\-party SAML solution providers with AWS<a name="id_roles_providers_saml_3rd-party"></a>

**Note**  
We recommend that you require your human users to use temporary credentials when accessing AWS\. Have you considered using AWS IAM Identity Center \(successor to AWS Single Sign\-On\)? You can use IAM Identity Center to centrally manage access to multiple AWS accounts and provide users with MFA\-protected, single sign\-on access to all their assigned accounts from one place\. With IAM Identity Center, you can create and manage user identities in IAM Identity Center or easily connect to your existing SAML 2\.0 compatible identity provider\. For more information, see [What is IAM Identity Center?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html) in the *AWS IAM Identity Center \(successor to AWS Single Sign\-On\) User Guide*\.

The following links help you configure third\-party SAML 2\.0 identity provider \(IdP\) solutions to work with AWS federation\.

**Tip**  
AWS Support engineers can assist customers who have business and enterprise support plans with some integration tasks that involve third\-party software\. For a current list of supported platforms and applications, see [What third\-party software is supported?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/faqs/#what3rdParty) in the *AWS Support FAQs*\.
