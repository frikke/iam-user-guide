# Construct a URL with AWS STS for federated users using an AWS SDK<a name="example_sts_Scenario_ConstructFederatedUrl_section"></a>

The following code example shows how to:
+ Create an IAM role that grants read\-only access to the current account's Amazon S3 resources\.
+ Get a security token from the AWS federation endpoint\.
+ Construct a URL that can be used to access the console with federated credentials\.
