# Manage IAM roles using an AWS SDK<a name="example_iam_Scenario_RoleManagement_section"></a>

The following code example shows how to:
+ Create an IAM role\.
+ Attach and detach policies for a role\.
+ Delete a role\.

**Note**  
The source code for these examples is in the [AWS Code Examples GitHub repository](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples)\. Have feedback on a code example? [Create an Issue](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/issues/new/choose) in the code examples repo\.
