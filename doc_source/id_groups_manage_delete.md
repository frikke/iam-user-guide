# Deleting an IAM user group<a name="id_groups_manage_delete"></a>

When you delete a user group in the AWS Management Console, the console automatically removes all group members, detaches all attached managed policies, and deletes all inline policies\. However, because IAM does not automatically delete policies that refer to the user group as a resource, you must be careful when you delete a user group\. Before you delete your user group, you must manually check all of your policies to find any policies that mention the group by name\. For example, John, the Test Team manager, has a policy attached to his IAM user entity that lets him add and remove users from the Test user group\. If an administrator deletes the group, the administrator must also delete the policy attached to John\. Otherwise, if the administrator recreates the deleted group and give it the same name, John's permissions remain in place, even if he left the Test Team\.

**To find policies that refer to a user group as a resource**

1. From the navigation pane of the IAM console, choose **Policies**\.

1. Sort by the **Type** column to find your **Customer managed** custom policies\.

1. Choose the policy name of the policy to delete\.

1. Choose the **Permissions** tab, and then choose **Summary**\.

1. Choose **IAM** from the list of services, if it exists\.

1. Look for the name of your user group in the **Resource** column\.

1. Choose **Delete** to delete the policy\.

1. Type the policy name to confirm deletion of the policy and choose **Delete**\. 

In contrast, when you use the AWS CLI, Tools for Windows PowerShell, or AWS API to delete a user group, you must first remove the users in the group\. Then delete any inline policies embedded in the user group\. Next, detach any managed policies that are attached to the group\. Only then can you delete the user group itself\.
