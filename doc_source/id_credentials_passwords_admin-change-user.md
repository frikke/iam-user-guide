# Managing passwords for IAM users<a name="id_credentials_passwords_admin-change-user"></a>

IAM users who use the AWS Management Console to work with AWS resources must have a password in order to sign in\. You can create, change, or delete a password for an IAM user in your AWS account\. 

After you have assigned a password to a user, the user can sign in to the AWS Management Console using the sign\-in URL for your account, which looks like this: 

```
https://12-digit-AWS-account-ID or alias.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
```

For more information about how IAM users sign in to the AWS Management Console, see [How to sign in to AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/how-to-sign-in.html) in the *AWS Sign\-In User Guide*\. 

Even if your users have their own passwords, they still need permissions to access your AWS resources\. By default, a user has no permissions\. To give your users the permissions they need, you assign policies to them or to the groups they belong to\. For information about creating users and groups, see [IAM Identities \(users, user groups, and roles\)](id.md)\. For information about using policies to set permissions, see [Changing permissions for an IAM user](id_users_change-permissions.md)\. 

You can grant users permission to change their own passwords\. For more information, see [Permitting IAM users to change their own passwords](id_credentials_passwords_enable-user-change.md)\. For information about how users access your account sign\-in page, see [How to sign in to AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/how-to-sign-in.html) in the *AWS Sign\-In User Guide*\.

## Creating, changing, or deleting an IAM user password \(console\)<a name="id_credentials_passwords_admin-change-user_console"></a>

You can use the AWS Management Console to manage passwords for your IAM users\.

When users leave your organization or no longer need AWS access, it is important to find the credentials that they were using and ensure that they are no longer operational\. Ideally, you delete credentials if they are no longer needed\. You can always recreate them at a later date if the need arises\. At the very least, you should change the credentials so that the former users no longer have access\.

**To add a password for an IAM user \(console\)**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**\.

1. Choose the name of the user whose password you want to create\. 

1. Choose the **Security credentials** tab, and then under **Console sign\-in**, choose **Enable console access**\.

1. In **Manage console access**, for **Console access** choose **Enable** if not already selected\. If console access is disabled, then no password is needed\.

1. For **Set password**, choose whether to have IAM generate a password or create a custom password: 
   + To have IAM generate a password, choose **Autogenerated password**\.
   + To create a custom password, choose **Custom password**, and type the password\. 
**Note**  
The password that you create must meet the account's [password policy](id_credentials_passwords_account-policy.md)\.

1. To require the user to create a new password when signing in, choose **User must create a new password at next sign\-in**\. Then choose **Apply**\.
**Important**  
If you select the **User must create a new password at next sign\-in** option, make sure that the user has permission to change his or her password\. For more information, see [Permitting IAM users to change their own passwords](id_credentials_passwords_enable-user-change.md)\.

1. If you choose the option to generate a password, choose **Show** in the **Console password** dialog box\. This lets you view the password so you can share it with the user\. 
**Important**  
For security reasons, you cannot access the password after completing this step, but you can create a new password at any time\.

**To change the password for an IAM user \(console\)**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**\.

1. Choose the name of the user whose password you want to change\. 

1. Choose the **Security credentials** tab, and then under **Console sign\-in**, choose **Manage console access**\.

1. In **Manage console access**, for **Console access** choose **Enable** if not already selected\. If console access is disabled, then no password is needed\.

1. For **Set password**, choose whether to have IAM generate a password or create a custom password: 
   + To have IAM generate a password, choose **Autogenerated password**\.
   + To create a custom password, choose **Custom password**, and type the password\. 
**Note**  
The password that you create must meet the account's [password policy](id_credentials_passwords_account-policy.md), if one is currently set\.

1. To require the user to create a new password when signing in, choose **User must create a new password at next sign\-in**\. Then choose **Apply**\.
**Important**  
If you select the **User must create a new password at next sign\-in** option, make sure that the user has permission to change his or her password\. For more information, see [Permitting IAM users to change their own passwords](id_credentials_passwords_enable-user-change.md)\.

1. If you choose the option to generate a password, choose **Show** in the **Console password** dialog box\. This lets you view the password so you can share it with the user\. 
**Important**  
For security reasons, you cannot access the password after completing this step, but you can create a new password at any time\.

**To delete \(disable\) an IAM user password \(console\)**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**\.

1. Choose the name of the user whose password you want to delete\. 

1. Choose the **Security credentials** tab, and then under **Console sign\-in**, choose **Manage console access**\.

1. For **Console access**, choose **Disable**, and then choose **Apply**\.

**Important**  
You can prevent an IAM user from accessing the AWS Management Console by removing their password\. This prevents them from signing in to the AWS Management Console using their sign\-in credentials\. It does not change their permissions or prevent them from accessing the console using an assumed role\. If the user has active access keys, they continue to function and allow access through the AWS CLI, Tools for Windows PowerShell, AWS API, or the AWS Console Mobile Application\.

## Creating, changing, or deleting an IAM user password \(AWS CLI\)<a name="Using_ManagingPasswordsCLIAPI"></a>

You can use the AWS CLI API to manage passwords for your IAM users\.

**To create a password \(AWS CLI\)**

1. \(Optional\) To determine whether a user has a password, run this command: [aws iam get\-login\-profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/get-login-profile.html)

1. To create a password, run this command: [aws iam create\-login\-profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/create-login-profile.html)

**To change a user's password \(AWS CLI\)**

1. \(Optional\) To determine whether a user has a password, run this command: [aws iam get\-login\-profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/get-login-profile.html)

1. To change a password, run this command: [aws iam update\-login\-profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/update-login-profile.html)

**To delete \(disable\) a user's password \(AWS CLI\)**

1. \(Optional\) To determine whether a user has a password, run this command: [aws iam get\-login\-profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/get-login-profile.html)

1. \(Optional\) To determine when a password was last used, run this command: [aws iam get\-user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/get-user.html)

1. To delete a password, run this command: [aws iam delete\-login\-profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/delete-login-profile.html)

**Important**  
When you delete a user's password, the user can no longer sign in to the AWS Management Console\. If the user has active access keys, they continue to function and allow access through the AWS CLI, Tools for Windows PowerShell, or AWS API function calls\. When you use the AWS CLI, Tools for Windows PowerShell, or AWS API to delete a user from your AWS account, you must first delete the password using this operation\.
