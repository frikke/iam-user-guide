# Creating a role using custom trust policies \(console\)<a name="id_roles_create_for-custom"></a>

You can create a custom trust policy to delegate access and allow others to perform actions in your AWS account\. For more information, see [Creating IAM policies](access_policies_create-console.md#access_policies_create-start)\.

For information about how to use roles to delegate permissions, see [Roles terms and concepts](id_roles_terms-and-concepts.md)\.

## Creating an IAM role using a custom trust policy \(console\)<a name="roles-creatingrole-custom-trust-policy-console"></a>

You can use the AWS Management Console to create a role that an IAM user can assume\. For example, assume that your organization has multiple AWS accounts to isolate a development environment from a production environment\. For high\-level information about creating a role that allows users in the development account to access resources in the production account, see [Example scenario using separate development and production accounts](id_roles_common-scenarios_aws-accounts.md#id_roles_common-scenarios_aws-accounts-example)\.

**To create a role using a custom trust policy \(console\)**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane of the console, choose **Roles** and then choose **Create role**\.

1. Choose the **Custom trust policy** role type\.

1. In the **Custom trust policy** section, enter or paste the custom trust policy for the role\. For more information, see [Creating IAM policies](access_policies_create-console.md#access_policies_create-start)\.

1. Resolve any security warnings, errors, or general warnings generated during [policy validation](access_policies_policy-validator.md), and then choose **Next**\.

1. Select the check box next to the custom trust policy you created\.

1. \(Optional\) Set a [permissions boundary](access_policies_boundaries.md)\. This is an advanced feature that is available for service roles, but not service\-linked roles\.

   Open the **Permissions boundary** section and choose **Use a permissions boundary to control the maximum role permissions**\. IAM includes a list of the AWS managed and customer managed policies in your account\. Select the policy to use for the permissions boundary\.

1. Choose **Next**\.

1. For **Role name**, the degree of role name customization is defined by the service\. If the service defines the role's name, this option is not editable\. In other cases, the service might define a prefix for the role and allow you to enter an optional suffix\. Some services allow you to specify the entire name of your role\.

   If possible, enter a role name or role name suffix\. Role names must be unique within your AWS account\. They are not distinguished by case\. For example, you cannot create roles named both **PRODROLE** and **prodrole**\. Because other AWS resources might reference the role, you cannot edit the name of the role after it has been created\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Description**, enter a description for the new role\.

1. Choose **Edit** in the **Step 1: Select trusted entities** or **Step 2: Add permissions** sections to edit the custom policy and permissions for the role\. 

1. \(Optional\) Add metadata to the role by attaching tags as keyâ€“value pairs\. For more information about using tags in IAM, see [Tagging IAM resources](id_tags.md)\.

1. Review the role and then choose **Create role**\.
