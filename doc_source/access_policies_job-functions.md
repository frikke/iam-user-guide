# AWS managed policies for job functions<a name="access_policies_job-functions"></a>

We recommend using policies that [grant least privilege](best-practices.md#grant-least-privilege), or granting only the permissions required to perform a task\. The most secure way to grant least privilege is to write a custom policy with only the permissions needed by your team\. You must create a process to allow your team to request more permissions when necessary\. It takes time and expertise to [create IAM customer managed policies](access_policies_create-console.md) that provide your team with only the permissions they need\.

To get started adding permissions to your IAM identities \(users, groups of users, and roles\), you can use [AWS managed policies](access_policies_managed-vs-inline.md#aws-managed-policies)\. AWS managed policies cover common use cases and are available in your AWS account\. AWS managed policies don't grant least privilege permissions\. You must consider the security risk of granting your principals more permissions than they need to do their job\.

You can attach AWS managed policies, including job functions, to any IAM identity\. To switch to least privilege permissions, you can run AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer to monitor principals with AWS managed policies\. After learning which permissions they are using, then you can write a custom policy or generate a policy with only the required permissions for your team\. This is less secure, but provides more flexibility as you learn how your team is using AWS\.

AWS managed policies for job functions are designed to closely align to common job functions in the IT industry\. You can use these policies to grant the permissions needed to carry out the tasks expected of someone in a specific job function\. These policies consolidate permissions for many services into a single policy that's easier to work with than having permissions scattered across many policies\.

**Use Roles to Combine Services**  
Some of the policies use IAM service roles to help you take advantage of features found in other AWS services\. These policies grant access to `iam:passrole`, which allows a user with the policy to pass a role to an AWS service\. This role delegates IAM permissions to the AWS service to carry out actions on your behalf\.

You must create the roles according to your needs\. For example, the Network Administrator policy allows a user with the policy to pass a role named "flow\-logs\-vpc" to the Amazon CloudWatch service\. CloudWatch uses that role to log and capture IP traffic for VPCs created by the user\.

To follow security best practices, the policies for job functions include filters that limit the names of valid roles that can be passed\. This helps avoid granting unnecessary permissions\. If your users do require the optional service roles, you must create a role that follows the naming convention specified in the policy\. You then grant permissions to the role\. Once that is done, the user can configure the service to use the role, granting it whatever permissions the role provides\.

In the following sections, each policy's name is a link to the policy details page in the AWS Management Console\. There you can see the policy document and review the permissions it grants\.

## Administrator job function<a name="jf_administrator"></a>

## Updates to AWS managed policies for job functions<a name="security-iam-awsmanpol-jobfunction-updates"></a>

These policies are all maintained by AWS and are kept up to date to include support for new services and new capabilities as they are added by AWS services\. These policies cannot be modified by customers\. You can make a copy of the policy and then modify the copy, but that copy is not automatically updated as AWS introduces new services and API operations\.

For a job function policy, you can view the version history and the time and date of each update in the IAM console\. To do this, use the links on this page to view the policy details\. Then choose the **Policy versions** tab to view the versions\. This page shows the last 25 versions of a policy\. To view all of the versions for a policy, call the [get\-policy\-version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/get-policy-version.html) AWS CLI command or the [GetPolicyVersion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetPolicyVersion.html) API operation\.

**Note**  
You can have up to five versions of a customer managed policy, but AWS retains the full version history of AWS managed policies\.
