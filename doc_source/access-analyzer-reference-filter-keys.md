# IAM Access Analyzer filter keys<a name="access-analyzer-reference-filter-keys"></a>

You can use the filter keys below to define an archive rule [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/access-analyzer/latest/APIReference/API_CreateArchiveRule.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/access-analyzer/latest/APIReference/API_CreateArchiveRule.html), update an archive rule [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/access-analyzer/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateArchiveRule.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/access-analyzer/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateArchiveRule.html), retrieve a list of findings [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/access-analyzer/latest/APIReference/API_ListFindings.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/access-analyzer/latest/APIReference/API_ListFindings.html), or retrieve a list of access preview findings for a resource [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/access-analyzer/latest/APIReference/API_ListAccessPreviewFindings.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/access-analyzer/latest/APIReference/API_ListAccessPreviewFindings.html)\. There is no difference between using IAM API and AWS CloudFormation for configuring archive rules\.
