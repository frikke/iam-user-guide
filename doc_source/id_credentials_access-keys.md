Access keys are long\-term credentials for an IAM user or the AWS account root user\. You can use access keys to sign programmatic requests to the AWS CLI or AWS API \(directly or using the AWS SDK\)\. For more information, see [Signing AWS API Requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\.

**Important**  
As a [best practice](best-practices.md), use temporary security credentials \(IAM roles\) instead of creating long\-term credentials like access keys, and don't create AWS account root user access keys\. We don't recommend generating access keys for your root user, because they allow full access to all your resources for all AWS services, including your billing information\. For more information, see [Best Practices for AWS accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/best-practices.html) in the *AWS Account Management Reference Guide*\.

Access keys consist of two parts: an access key ID \(for example, `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`\) and a secret access key \(for example, `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`\)\. You must use both the access key ID and secret access key together to authenticate your requests\.

If you still need to use long\-term access keys, you can create, modify, view, or rotate your access keys \(access key IDs and secret access keys\)\. You can have a maximum of two access keys\. To follow best practices, rotate the access keys regularly\. For more information, see [Rotating access keys](#Using_RotateAccessKey)\.

When you create an access key pair, save the access key ID and secret access key in a secure location\. The secret access key is available only at the time you create it\. If you lose your secret access key, you must delete the access key and create a new one\. For more details, see [Resetting lost or forgotten passwords or access keys for AWS](id_credentials_access-keys_retrieve.md)\.

**Important**  
 Manage your access keys securely\. Do not provide your access keys to unauthorized parties, even to help [find your account identifiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/acct-identifiers.html)\. By doing this, you might give someone permanent access to your account\.

## Permissions required<a name="access-keys_required-permissions"></a>

**Note**  
`iam:TagUser` is an optional permission for adding and editing descriptions for the access key\. For more information, see [Tagging IAM users](id_tags_users.md)

To create access keys for your own IAM user, you must have the permissions from the following policy:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "CreateOwnAccessKeys",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:CreateAccessKey",
                "iam:GetUser",
                "iam:ListAccessKeys",
                "iam:TagUser"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::*:user/${aws:username}"
        }
    ]
}
```

To rotate access keys for your own IAM user, you must have the permissions from the following policy:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "ManageOwnAccessKeys",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:CreateAccessKey",
                "iam:DeleteAccessKey",
                "iam:GetAccessKeyLastUsed",
                "iam:GetUser",
                "iam:ListAccessKeys",
                "iam:UpdateAccessKey",
                "iam:TagUser"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::*:user/${aws:username}"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Managing access keys \(console\)<a name="Using_CreateAccessKey"></a>

You can use the AWS Management Console to manage the access keys of an IAM user\.

**To create, modify, or delete your own IAM user access keys \(console\)**

1. Use your AWS account ID or account alias, your IAM user name, and your password to sign in to the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam)\.
**Note**  
For your convenience, the AWS sign\-in page uses a browser cookie to remember your IAM user name and account information\. If you previously signed in as a different user, choose **Sign in to a different account** near the bottom of the page to return to the main sign\-in page\. From there, you can type your AWS account ID or account alias to be redirected to the IAM user sign\-in page for your account\.

   To get your AWS account ID, contact your administrator\.

1. In the navigation bar on the upper right, choose your user name, and then choose **Security credentials**\.   
![\[AWS Management Console Security credentials link\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/images/security-credentials-user.shared.console.png)

Do one of the following:

**To create an access key**

1. In the **Access keys** section, choose **Create access key**\. If you already have two access keys, this button is deactivated and you must delete an access key before you can create a new one\.

1. On the **Access key best practices & alternatives** page, choose your use case to learn about additional options which can help you avoid creating a long\-term access key\. If you determine that your use case still requires an access key, choose **Other** and then choose **Next**\.

1. \(Optional\) Set a description tag value for the access key\. This adds a tag key\-value pair to your IAM user\. This can help you identify and rotate access keys later\. The tag key is set to the access key id\. The tag value is set to the access key description that you specify\. When you are finished, choose **Create access key**\.

1. On the **Retrieve access keys** page, choose either **Show** to reveal the value of your user's secret access key, or **Download \.csv file**\. This is your only opportunity to save your secret access key\. After you've saved your secret access key in a secure location, choose **Done**\.

**To deactivate an access key**
+ In the **Access keys** section find the key you want to deactivate, then choose **Actions**, then choose **Deactivate**\. When prompted for confirmation, choose **Deactivate**\. A deactivated access key still counts toward your limit of two access keys\.

**To activate an access key**
+ In the **Access keys** section, find the key to activate, then choose **Actions**, then choose **Activate**\.

**To delete an access key when you no longer need it**
+ In the **Access keys** section, find the key you want to delete, then choose **Actions**, then choose **Delete**\. Follow the instructions in the dialog to first **Deactivate** and then confirm the deletion\. We recommend that you verify that the access key is no longer in use before you permanently delete it\.

**To create, modify, or delete the access keys of another IAM user \(console\)**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**\.

1. Choose the name of the user whose access keys you want to manage, and then choose the **Security credentials** tab\.

1. In the **Access keys** section, do any of the following:
   + To create an access key, choose **Create access key**\. If the button is deactivated, then you must delete one of the existing keys before you can create a new one\. On the **Access key best practices & alternatives** page, review the best practices and alternatives\. Choose your use case to learn about additional options which can help you avoid creating a long\-term access key\. If you determine that your use case still requires an access key, choose **Other** and then choose **Next**\. On the **Retrieve access key page**, choose **Show** to reveal the value of your user's secret access key\. To save the access key ID and secret access key to a `.csv` file to a secure location on your computer, choose the **Download \.csv file** button\. When you create an access key for your user, that key pair is active by default, and your user can use the pair right away\.
   + To deactivate an active access key, choose **Actions**, and then choose **Deactivate**\.
   + To activate an inactive access key, choose **Actions**, and then choose **Activate**\.
   + To delete your access key, choose **Actions**, and then choose **Delete**\. Follow the instructions in the dialog to first **Deactivate** and then confirm the deletion\. AWS recommends that before you do this, you first deactivate the key and test that itâ€™s no longer in use\. When you use the AWS Management Console, you must deactivate your key before deleting it\.

**To list the access keys for an IAM user \(console\)**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**\.

1. Choose the name of the intended user, and then choose the **Security credentials** tab\. In the **Access keys** section, you will see the user's access keys and the status of each key displayed\.
**Note**  
Only the user's access key ID is visible\. The secret access key can only be retrieved when the key is created\.

**To list the access key IDs for multiple IAM users \(console\)**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**\.

1. If necessary, add the **Access key ID** column to the users table by completing the following steps:

   1. Above the table on the far right, choose the settings icon \(![\[Settings icon\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/images/console-settings-icon.console.png)\)\.

   1. In **Manage columns**, select **Access key ID**\.

   1. Choose **Close** to return to the list of users\.

1. The **Access key ID** column shows each access key ID, followed by its state; for example, **23478207027842073230762374023 \(Active\)** or **22093740239670237024843420327 \(Inactive\)**\. 

   You can use this information to view and copy the access keys for users with one or two access keys\. The column displays **None** for users with no access key\.
**Note**  
Only the user's access key ID and status is visible\. The secret access key can only be retrieved when the key is created\.

**To find which IAM user owns a specific access key \(console\)**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**\.

1. In the search box, type or paste the access key ID of the user you want to find\.

1. If necessary, add the **Access key ID** column to the users table by completing the following steps:

   1. Above the table on the far right, choose the settings icon \(![\[Settings icon\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/images/console-settings-icon.console.png)\)\.

   1. In **Manage columns**, select **Access key ID**\.

   1. Choose **Close** to return to the list of users and confirm that the filtered user owns the specified access key\.

## Rotating access keys<a name="Using_RotateAccessKey"></a>

As a security best practice, we recommend that you regularly rotate \(change\) IAM user access keys\. Regularly rotating long\-term credentials helps you familiarize yourself with the process\. This is useful in case you are ever in a situation where you must rotate credentials, such as when an employee leaves your company\. If your administrator granted you the necessary permissions, you can rotate your own access keys\.

Administrators, for details about granting your users permissions to rotate their own access keys, see [AWS: Allows IAM users to manage their own password, access keys, and SSH public keys on the My security credentials page](reference_policies_examples_aws_my-sec-creds-self-manage-pass-accesskeys-ssh.md)\. You can also apply a password policy to your account to require that all of your IAM users periodically rotate their passwords\. You can choose how often they must do so\. For more information, see [Setting an account password policy for IAM users](id_credentials_passwords_account-policy.md)\. 

**Important**  
  When you create an AWS account, you begin with one sign\-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account\. This identity is called the AWS account *root user* and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account\. We strongly recommend that you don't use the root user for your everyday tasks\. Safeguard your root user credentials and use them to perform the tasks that only the root user can perform\. For the complete list of tasks that require you to sign in as the root user, see [Tasks that require root user credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/root-user-tasks.html) in the *AWS Account Management Reference Guide*\. Because the AWS account root user credentials are long\-term credentials, we recommend that you also regularly rotate them\. The account password policy does not apply to the root user credentials\. IAM users cannot manage credentials for the AWS account root user\. You must use the root user credentials to change the root user credentials\.

### Rotating IAM user access keys \(console\)<a name="rotating_access_keys_console"></a>

You can rotate access keys from the AWS Management Console\.

**To rotate access keys for an IAM user without interrupting your applications \(console\)**

1. While the first access key is still active, create a second access key\.

   1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

   1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**\.

   1. Choose the name of the intended user, and then choose the **Security credentials** tab\.

   1. In the **Access keys** section, choose **Create access key**\. On the **Access key best practices & alternatives** page, choose **Other**, then choose **Next**\.

   1. \(Optional\) Set a description tag value for the access key to add a tag key\-value pair to this IAM user\. This can help you identify and rotate access keys later\. The tag key is set to the access key id\. The tag value is set to the access key description that you specify\. When you are finished, choose **Create access key**\.

   1. On the **Retrieve access keys** page, choose either **Show** to reveal the value of your user's secret access key, or **Download \.csv file**\. This is your only opportunity to save your secret access key\. After you've saved your secret access key in a secure location, choose **Done**\.

      When you create an access key for your user, that key pair is active by default, and your user can use the pair right away\. At this point, the user has two active access keys\.

1. Update all applications and tools to use the new access key\.

1. <a name="id_credentials_access-keys-key-still-in-use"></a>Determine whether the first access key is still in use by reviewing the **Last used** information for the oldest access key\. One approach is to wait several days and then check the old access key for any use before proceeding\.

1. Even if the **Last used** information indicates that the old key has never been used, we recommend that you do not immediately delete the first access key\. Instead, choose **Actions** and then choose **Deactivate** to deactivate the first access key\.

1. Use only the new access key to confirm that your applications are working\. Any applications and tools that still use the original access key will stop working at this point because they no longer have access to AWS resources\. If you find such an application or tool, you can reactivate the first access key\. Then return to [Step 3](#id_credentials_access-keys-key-still-in-use) and update this application to use the new key\.

1. After you wait some period of time to ensure that all applications and tools have been updated, you can delete the first access key:

   1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

   1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**\.

   1. Choose the name of the intended user, and then choose the **Security credentials** tab\.

   1. In the **Access keys** section for the access key you want to delete, choose **Actions**, and then choose **Delete**\. Follow the instructions in the dialog to first **Deactivate** and then confirm the deletion\.

**To determine when access keys need rotating \(console\)**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**\.

1. If necessary, add the **Access key age** column to the users table by completing the following steps:

   1. Above the table on the far right, choose the settings icon \(![\[Settings icon\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/images/console-settings-icon.console.png)\)\.

   1. In **Manage columns**, select **Access key age**\.

   1. Choose **Close** to return to the list of users\.

1. The **Access key age** column shows the number of days since the oldest active access key was created\. You can use this information to find users with access keys that need rotating\. The column displays **None** for users with no access key\.

### Rotating access keys \(AWS CLI\)<a name="rotating_access_keys_cli"></a>

You can rotate access keys from the AWS Command Line Interface\.

**To rotate access keys without interrupting your applications \(AWS CLI\)**

1. While the first access key is still active, create a second access key, which is active by default\. Run the following command:
   + [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/create-access-key.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/create-access-key.html)

     At this point, the user has two active access keys\.

1. <a name="step-update-apps"></a>Update all applications and tools to use the new access key\.

   One approach is to wait several days and then check the old access key for any use before proceeding\.

1. Even if step [Step 3](#step-determine-use) indicates no use of the old key, we recommend that you do not immediately delete the first access key\. Instead, change the state of the first access key to `Inactive` using this command:
   +  [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/update-access-key.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/update-access-key.html)

1. Use only the new access key to confirm that your applications are working\. Any applications and tools that still use the original access key will stop working at this point because they no longer have access to AWS resources\. If you find such an application or tool, you can switch its state back to `Active` to reactivate the first access key\. Then return to step [Step 2](#step-update-apps) and update this application to use the new key\.

1. After you wait some period of time to ensure that all applications and tools have been updated, you can delete the first access key with this command:

## Auditing access keys<a name="Using_access-keys-audit"></a>

You can review the AWS access keys in your code to determine whether the keys are from an account that you own\. You can pass an access key ID using the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sts/get-access-key-info.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sts/get-access-key-info.html) AWS CLI command or the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_GetAccessKeyInfo.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_GetAccessKeyInfo.html) AWS API operation\.

The AWS CLI and AWS API operations return the ID of the AWS account to which the access key belongs\. Access key IDs beginning with `AKIA` are long\-term credentials for an IAM user or an AWS account root user\. Access key IDs beginning with `ASIA` are temporary credentials that are created using AWS STS operations\. If the account in the response belongs to you, you can sign in as the root user and review your root user access keys\. Then, you can pull a [credentials report](id_credentials_getting-report.md) to learn which IAM user owns the keys\. To learn who requested the temporary credentials for an `ASIA` access key, view the AWS STS events in your CloudTrail logs\.

For security purposes, you can [review AWS CloudTrail logs](cloudtrail-integration.md#cloudtrail-integration_signin-tempcreds) to learn who performed an action in AWS\. You can use the `sts:SourceIdentity` condition key in the role trust policy to require users to specify an identity when they assume a role\. For example, you can require that IAM users specify their own user name as their source identity\. This can help you determine which user performed a specific action in AWS\. For more information, see [`sts:SourceIdentity`](reference_policies_iam-condition-keys.md#ck_sourceidentity)\.

This operation does not indicate the state of the access key\. The key might be active, inactive, or deleted\. Active keys might not have permissions to perform an operation\. Providing a deleted access key might return an error that the key doesn't exist\.
